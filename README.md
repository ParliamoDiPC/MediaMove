# MediaMove
Yet another small solo project of mine, this time it's (or better, it should become) a keyboard-based file (expecially media) organizer. Writing this in c++ under Mit license. Hope you will enjoy it when it will finally be ready.

External libraries etc.: SDL2 and its extensions + Bootstrap Icons
